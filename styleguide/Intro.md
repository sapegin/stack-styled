# Stack Styled

React component to make stack layouts easy: adds whitespace horizontal and vertical whitespace between each child element but not around the container. Based on [styled-system](https://jxnblk.com/styled-system/table). We recommend to use this component with [Grid Styled](https://jxnblk.com/grid-styled/).

## Installation

```bash
npm install stack-styled
```
